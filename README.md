# Machine-Learning
In this repository, I will present a portfolio analyzing the revenue, ranking, and reviews of the movies in the theatre. 

I have crawled data from website (Naver, Rotten Tomato), assembled and modified data using Maria DB, SQL, and Excel. Then, I analyzed each variant and presented it in HTML where you can see real-time analysis of each movie.
