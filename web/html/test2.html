            Han always wanted to swim with dolphin
            so Han persuade Momo to go to Hawaii ans swim
            with dolphins but Momo said <br>
            "send me a postcard thank you"<br>
            Han became a grumpy.
            And Han died and born as a shark in her next life<br>
            On a stormy night, there was a tornado
            Tornado reached to Han and Hanna and Han became SharkHanNado
