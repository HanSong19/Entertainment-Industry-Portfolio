                    Filmed from 2001 to 2013, Boyhood depicts the childhood and adolescence of Mason Evans Jr. (Coltrane) from ages six to eighteen as he grows up in Texas with divorced parents (Arquette and Hawke). 
                    Richard Linklater's daughter Lorelei plays Mason's sister, Samantha.
                    Production began in 2001 and finished in 2013, with Linklater's goal to make a film about growing up. The project began without a completed script, with only basic plot points and the ending written initially. 
                    Linklater developed the script throughout production, writing the next year's portion of the film after rewatching the previous year's footage. 
                    He incorporated changes he saw in each actor into the script, while also allowing all major actors to participate in the writing process by incorporating their life experiences into their characters' stories.
                    Boyhood premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival[4] and was released theatrically on July 11, 2014.[5] The film competed in the main competition section of the 64th Berlin International Film Festival,[6] 
                    where Linklater won the Silver Bear for Best Director.[7] It received universal acclaim from critics, earning praise for its performances, emotional depth, and characters.
                    It was also nominated for five Golden Globe Awards, winning Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actress for Arquette; five BAFTA awards, winning for Best Director and Best Film; 
                    and six Academy Awards, winning Best Supporting Actress for Arquette.
